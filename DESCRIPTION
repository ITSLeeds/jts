Description: Provides easy access to the UK
    Department for Transport's Journey Time Statistics
    <https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/journey-time-statistics-data-tables-jts>.
    Adds value to the raw data by pre-processing the datasets and (optionally)
    returning geographic classes, enabling visualisation of journey times
    by different modes of transport to different services in cartographic maps.
